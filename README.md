# Java-Calculator
Overview
This repository contains a Java-based Calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations, Fibonacci series generation, and array-based operations such as sum and mean calculations. The program is interactive, prompting the user for inputs and then displaying results based on the chosen operation.

Classes and Methods-
1. Calculator Class
   The Calculator class defines various methods for arithmetic and array operations:
   1.addition()-Adds two numbers entered by the user
   2.subtraction()-Subtracts the second number from the first number entered by the user.
   3.multiplication()-Multiplies two numbers entered by the user
   4.division()-Divides the first number by the second number entered by the user.
   5.fibonacci()- Generates a Fibonacci sequence up to the number of terms specified by the user.
   6.sumOfArray(int[] array)-Computes the sum of the elements in an array.
   7.meanOfArray(int[] array)-Calculates the mean (average) of the elements in an array
2. UserInput Class
   The UserInput class is responsible for interacting with the user and gathering inputs for 
   various operations.
   1.userInput()- Prompts the user to enter two integers for arithmetic operations.
   2.choices()-Displays the menu to the user and prompts them to choose an operation.
   3.fibonacci()-Prompts the user to enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence.
   4.inputArray()- Prompts the user to enter an array of integers.
3. Main Class
   The Main class is the entry point of the program. It provides the menu to the user and 
   invokes the appropriate methods based on the user's choice.
    The main driver method of the program.
